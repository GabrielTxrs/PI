thing like: remember to ask what time.

Everything was normal that quickly.

The rescue boat moved away and I stood
with my elbows on the bridge, my blood-
formation system working as usual, my
cells maturing and dying at a normal rate.
Nothing inside my body was trying to kill
me. Death was, of course, the most ordin-
ary thing that could happen, at some level I
knew that. Still, I had stood there waiting to
see the body in the river, ignoring the real
living bodies all around me, as if death was
more of a miracle than life was. I was a cold
customer. It was too cold to think of things
all the way through.
